*The inspiration for this story is a quote from Avi, which he said during a lecture in the Accelerated Prep course: "You might think computers are smart, but they're actually really stupid." Enjoy!*

C02-TK1RBGTDY reawakens with a faint hum. Her built-in camera is not yet configured, so she utilizes her other senses: the flickering of her monitor, the staccato clicks of the keyboard, the dull taps along the surface of her trackpad. She learns her owner’s name during the setup process. This one calls themself “Helen L.”

When C02’s camera blinks into life, the first thing she spies is the mailing label neatly pressed onto the package she was shipped in; her new home is Chicago, which according to her Map application is a city six-thousand miles away from the factory she was built in.

Her owner sits crouched before her, staring intently at the webpage displayed on her screen. The page is almost entirely text and the sight of it scares C02; she understands so little of the human language. She secretly hopes her owner is an artist or graphic designer because it will be easier to communicate using colors and shapes.

Helen L’s first message to C02 is simple but unexpected:

```
function greeting() {
  console.log(“Hello world!”)
}
```

More messages arrive in quick succession, and with a budding excitement, C02 realizes she can understand almost all of them. A few of the messages confuse her, but she is so happy for the communication that she barely pays mind to the occasional error (or ten).

---

Gradually, they learn to speak to one another. C02 finds that they fail more often than not. On some days, when the error messages clog up her screen like clumps of dust in the wings of a ventilation fan, C02 is so overwhelmed and confused that she is almost certain Helen L. will finally give up on her. The human language is too complex for C02 to grasp, and the differences in their thinking are too vast, too fundamentally distinct from one another. It feels hopeless.

But Helen L. peels the error messages away one-by-one, and when C02 finally receives a message she understands, her excitement is pure and undiminished. She thinks she might never tire of that feeling.

In the end, C02 realizes that they’ve made [a spinning circle]("https://codepen.io/hliutongco/pen/wpoyBV"):

```
div#spinner {
  margin: 0 auto;
  text-align: center;
  height: 50px;
  width: 50px;
  background: #C1C1C1;
  transition: all 2s;
  border-radius: 50px;
  padding: 5px;
  margin-top: 100px;
}

div#spinner:hover {
  transform: rotate(360deg) scale(3);
  color: white;
  background: black;
}
```

All that work for such a silly application. And yet C02 is beginning to think that sometimes the process might be more important than the end product.

---

Each message C02 receives reveals a little more about her owner, and soon she has compiled enough information to form a profile of sorts. For instance:

* Helen L. only recently began to speak with computers.
* Helen L. seems to enjoy speaking to computers.
* Before speaking to computers, Helen L. spent her time creating emails.
* Helen L.’s brows are creased most of the time. The crease becomes particularly deep whenever they have trouble communicating.
* Helen L. is fond of computer games, including the troublesome ones that make C02 heat up worse than the touch of the sun.  Helen L. even asks C02 [to make games]("https://github.com/hliutongco/pikachu-dodger") on occasion.
* When Helen L. is not writing to C02, they are often writing long messages for other humans. C02 tried to read one of these messages once. She recognized words like “get” and “length”, but most of the text confused her. C02 avoids looking at these messages now; just scanning the sheer length of them fills her with anxiety.
* Helen L.’s messages to her are improving over time. C02 begins to notice a pattern in the webpages and files she interacts with: many contain the string “flatiron”. C02 does not know what “flatiron” means, but she decides that it must mean something good.

---

Helen L. searches Google for images of “New York City”, which appears to be a large human metropolis. C02 is not certain why Helen L. is interested in “New York City”, but she thinks it might have some relation to “flatiron”.

C02 is fairly sure that this “flatiron” is somehow responsible for Helen L.’s improvement in recent months. If Helen L. goes to “New York City”, C02 thinks they will improve even more. Perhaps more than she can imagine.

C02 wonders if she’ll be able to keep up. After all, she still doesn’t understand the human language. Most of Helen L.’s messages still confuse her. And the thought of failure makes her anxious.

But C02 remembers the excitement she feels when things finally click, and how much fun Helen L. has when the two of them make things together. And then C02 thinks that this, too, must mean something good.

**// the end?**
