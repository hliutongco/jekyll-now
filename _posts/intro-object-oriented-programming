title: Super Simple Intro to Object Oriented Programming

So let's say that you've decided to flex your programming abilities by making a series of simple games. Let's also say that you decided to make these games using Ruby, because why not?

You start by creating a couple methods for your games:

```
def tictactoe
  #Insert code for tic tac toe game
end

def hangman
  #Insert code for hangman game
end

def guess_the_number
  #Insert code for guess the number game
end
```

As you begin to write your code, you realize that your #tictactoe, #hangman, and #guess_the_number methods are becoming very unwieldy very quick. Not only do you need to build several separate methods within each method, but you also realize that your three games share a lot of similar code. If only there were a good way to organize these methods, and to standardize the bits of code that are used across all three games.

This is precisely where **classes** come in handy.
