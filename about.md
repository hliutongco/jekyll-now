*Code Meets Girl* is a quirky blog from a quirky coding newbie. I take stuff that I struggle to understand, learn them as best as I can, and then try to explain them in a way that doesn't sound like gobbledygook.

Learning to code is hard, but we can still have fun doing it. Have some dancing pikachus:
